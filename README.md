Go Robots.txt Downloader

This is a simple Go program that downloads the /robots.txt file from a list of domains and saves it to a newly created folder with the same name as the domain.
Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Go installed on your system. If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from the official Go website.
Usage

    Create a file named domains.txt in the same directory as the program.
    Add the list of domains, one per line, to the domains.txt file.
    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is located.
    Run the command go run main.go to start the program.
    The program will create a new directory for each domain in the domains.txt file and download the /robots.txt file to the directory.
